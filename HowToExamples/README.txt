HEV HowToExamples
-----------------

The purpose of this directory is to collect a series on examples of
how to do something or illustrate a technique using the HEV software.

These examples are NOT standard demos in that they typically don't
follow the usual demo structure of a "rundemo" script to run it and a
src/GNUmakefile to build it.

The only requirement is each example should have a README.txt to
explain its purpose, how to run it (if the is something to run) and
what it illustrates or explains. If binary files are used all
necessary source or ASCII data files with instructions for building
the binaries should be included.

As a rule of thumb, try to keep these examples small and covering one
topic.

Anything of use to HEV users/developers is appropriate here.
