Notes on installing Bullet Physics
Steve Satterfield

--> updated by John Kelso 8/10/2012 for IRIS install.
--> Skip down to "Steps building on Dradis (per above directions)" below

To use this library to build an application, use hev-animateWindow(1), as an
example. It has the "magic" needed to be added for our standard GNUmakefile.

Matthew Du has coded up the dynamics of breaking glass using the 
        bullet physics Engine
    a) The bullet physics engine needs installing for everyone before 
       installing his code.
          Bullet is on the web at http://bulletphysics.org/wordpress/
        Here is a set of instructions on how to get Bullet 2.76 working .

   1. Download Bullet 2.76 and cmake 2.8
   2. cd into bullet-2.76/ and enter "cmake . -G "Unix Makefiles"
   3. Enter "./autogen.sh"
   4. In bullet-2.76/Demos/ copy the "Makefile.in" file
   5. Make a new directory in Demos/ called "ColladaDemo" and paste the 
      "Makefile.in" file into that directory
   6. Enter "./autogen.sh" then "./configure" then "make"
   7. cd into bullet-2.76/Demos/AllBulletDemos/
   8. enter "./AllBulletDemo"

   Install it where ode is


   b) Matthew has a code that uses bullet to create the dynamics of 
      glass blow outs. Please install that

       It is for the fire project

Steps building on Dradis (per above directions)

      umask 2
      
      cd $HEVROOT/external
      mkdir bulletphysics
      tar xvf bullet-2.76.tgz

      cd bullet-2.76

      cmake -G "Unix Makefiles"

      ./autogen.sh
      # This line is odd in that it fails, 
      
      mkdir Demos/ColladaDemo
      cp Demos/Makefile.in  Demos/ColladaDemo

      ./autogen.sh

      ./configure 

      make -j8

      # do the following on dradis once, to create some files
      # needed for the demos to work
      cd into bullet-2.76/Demos/AllBulletDemos/
      ./AllBulletDemo

      # Now the push gets running demo out to the clients.
      # such that the following works for production HEV


      cd $HEVROOT/external/bulletphysics/bullet-2.76/Demos/AllBulletDemos
      --> in IRIS it's in $HEVROOT/external/bulletphysics/bullet-2.76/Demos/AllBulletDemos
      ./AllBulletDemo

       --> get the group and permission stuff right
           cd $HEVROOT/external/bulletphysics
           chmod -R g+w . ; \
	   find . -type d -print0 | xargs -0 chmod g+s ; \
	   chgrp -R diverse .

The above is the current installation. Below are various other notes trying to
do a "make install" instead of the install in place per above.

So the following notes can be ignored, I have them here just as an archive of
stuff I tried



Notes for reference only that didn't work in any useful way.

      cd bullet-2.76

      
      D=$HEVROOT/external/bulletphysics/bullet-2.76

      CUSTOM1="-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$D"
      CUSTOM2=" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH=$D"
      BDIR=/usr/local/HEV/external/bulletphysics/bullet-2.76

      cmake $BDIR -G "Unix Makefiles"  -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON $CUSTOM1 $CUSTOM2

      
      ./autogen.sh
      # This line is odd in that it fails, 
      
      mkdir Demos/ColladaDemo
      cp Demos/Makefile.in  Demos/ColladaDemo

      ./autogen.sh

      ./configure --prefix=$D

      make -j4


     Try the following without cmake

    ./autogen.sh

      mkdir Demos/ColladaDemo
      cp Demos/Makefile.in  Demos/ColladaDemo

      ./autogen.sh

      D=$HEVROOT/external/bulletphysics/bullet-2.76
      ./configure --prefix=$D

      make -j8
