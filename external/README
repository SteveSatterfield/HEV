The directory $HEVROOT/external is for the installation of software
packages from sources outside of NIST, typically needed to support the
core HEV and/or HEV applications.

Each software package should be a self contained top level directory.

Each software package should use application-specific bin, included,
lib, man directories within their respective directories. There should
NOT be common bin, lib, man directories.

Each software package should have its own profile which is sourced by
the user to set PATH and other specific environment variables.

Each software package should be installed in both
/usr/local/HEV/external and /usr/local/HEV-beta/external.  At the
choice of the installer, the beta installation can be done with a
symlink.

Each software package must be installed as group 'diverse' and group
writable.

Each software package should have a file named "nistInstallationNotes"
with installation details including the steps use to do the installation.
