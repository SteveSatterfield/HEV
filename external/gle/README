The source of in this directory is a slightly modified version
of the GLE extrusion library originally developed by Linas Vepstas.
It is being used under the GNU General Public License. 

We are using version 3.1.0 (gle-3.1.0.tar.gz) that was downloaded 
from http://www.linas.org/gle/pub on 28 August, 2008.

Small modifications to the source code have been made at the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (www.nist.gov)
by John Hagedorn.  Modifications are indicated by comments in 
the source code.  

We made these modifications to suit our own purposes in building
some small extrusion utilities.  These modified source files or the 
library that is built from them are not intended to be useful in any 
other context.
