-tjg

The purpose of this directory, $HEVROOT/test, is for testing the
correct operation of the HEV software. Sub-directories should be used
to group tests of a similar function.

./renderTest - is a collection of test cases for testing proper rendering
                 of HEV when compared over time, for different graphics
                 cards and drivers.

./functionalityTest - a collection of test cases for testing proper 
                 functioning of HEV software when compared over time
                 to insure changes do not negatively impact existing
                 software.
