This is an example fltk program which displays an image in a sub-window and
reports the position of the cursor when it's clicked inside the image.

To use this as a base for your application:

1) create a new directory for your work and go to the new directory. For
this example, call it "myNewApplication"

     mkdir myNewApplication
     cd myNewApplication

2) copy the example files

     cp $HEVROOT/idea/examples/showCursorPositionInImage/* .

  and rename the files:

    mv showCursorPositionInImage.cpp myNewApplication.cpp
    mv showCursorPositionInImageFunctions.h myNewApplicationFunctions.h
    mv showCursorPositionInImageGUI.fl myNewApplicationGUI.fl

3) edit the GNUmakefile, changing the file old names to the new file names

4) start modifying the program by running fluid:

   fluid myNewApplicationGIU.fl

5) then edit the other files, changing showCursorPositionInImage to myNewApplication, and
   modifying the callbacks, functions and variables as needed.

   myNewApplication.cpp is used to call the widgets created by
   myNewApplicationGIU.fl

   myNewApplicationFunctions.h contains the functions called by
   myNewApplicationGIU.fl and global variables used in myNewApplication.cpp

6) make and run:

   make && ./myNewApplication wallacegromit.jpg
