creates a fltk two-state button

need to specify:

- name of a dtk shared memory file to read/write state, creates if doesn't
  exist

- text to send to stdout when button is pressed, released

- initialize shared memory and buttons on startup

- button label

need to do:

- have a timer callback that polls shared memory and if the value changes,
  calls the button's action and sets the button's widget

- have a button callback that calls the button's actions and sets the shared
  memory

need to resolve:

- how to handle connecting the shared memory buttons to the dtk servers?
  (look at collabfly notes)

- can two copies of hev-collabButton share the same shared memory file on a
  local machone, as well as two copies of same file via remote dtk server?
