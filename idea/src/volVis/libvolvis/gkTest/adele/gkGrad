# This script executes an approximation of the tutorial at:
#     http://teem.sourceforge.net/bane/intro/index.html
# It is only an approximation because interfaces to
# some of the programs have (apparently) changed since the
# tutorial was written.
#
#
# Everything is done by executing the programs that were
# built with Teem.

# Here's where to find the executables:
BINDIR=$HEVROOT/external/teem/teem-1.6.0-src/linux.64/bin


$BINDIR/vprobe     \
    -k scalar \
    -q grad \
    -i set9559.nhdr \
    -o set9559.grad.nrrd
