.SH NAME
vol-opacityAdjust - Interactive adjustment of opacity in volume renderings.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B vol-opacityAdjust [--noescape] nodeName

.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBvol-opacityAdjust\fR displays a GUI that enables the user to 
adjust parameters that control opacity in a volume visualization.

This program changes the values of several GLSL uniforms that are
used by the GLSL shader programs generated by the \fIvol-visBuilder\fR.
This is accomplished by writing IRIS control commands to standard output,
thus the output of this command should typically be redirected 
to $IRIS_CONTROL_FIFO.

\fBvol-opacityAdjust\fR 
is automatically included in the visualizations created by
\fIvol-visBuilder\fR.

.TP
.B nodeName
The name of the node in the scene graph at which the opacity changes are
to occur.  This is the node at which the values of the 
GLSL uniform variables will be changed.


.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B --noescape
If this option is present, the program will not be terminated
when the escape key is pressed.

.TP
.B --init alphaOffset alphaScale density
Initializes the three parameters specified by the GUI.
AlphaOffset must be be in the range (-1,1); alphaScale and density 
must be greater than 0.

.SH EXAMPLES

The best examples of the use of this program can be found in the
visualization applications generated by vol-visBuilder.
In those applications, \fBvol-opacityAdjust\fR is used in the 
the file <name>.addToMcp.mcp.

But a typical use of the program would look like this:

.B    vol-opacityAdjust ten.geom > $IRIS_CONTROL_FIFO

Where "ten.geom" is the name of a node in the scene graph at which
one wants to change the opacity parameters.
