TODO:
  - Implement plane from BAN
  - Allow property toggling from list of generated isosurfaces
  - Clipping plane manipulation from Qt
    - Reasonably good; only works in X-Y plane
  - Background color
  - Alpha compositing

BUGS:
  - creating new isosurface of same column replaces existing isosurface
    but doesn't update the list of isosurfaces in qt
  - V toggle doesn't toggle off all timesteps
