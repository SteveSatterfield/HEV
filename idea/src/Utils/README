I have added additional functions to this library that are used by
hev-intSlider, hev-uniformSlider, and hev-uniformRoller.

The original purpose of the Utils directory was to have a place to park some
of our more generic functions. It's was to be analogous to the iris::Utils
library, but perhaps with functions more specific to our particular HEV
environment.

Any methods that get added to the libIdea.so also need to be added to the
idea/Utils.h file. 

At some point it would be nice to run doxygen on Utils.h.
