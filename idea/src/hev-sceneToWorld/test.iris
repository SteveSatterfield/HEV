# so the wand node gets updated as the wand shared memory changes, use "W" to see the wand move
# and use the desktopWand to move the wand
DSO setHeadWand

# create a process to turn the wand position into a matrix in world coords
EXEC hev-sceneToWorld wand tmp/worldWand

# and another process to turn it back into scene coords
EXEC hev-worldToScene tmp/worldWand tmp/sceneWand

# this node reads the worldWand matrix from shared memory when left button is pressed
SHMMATRIXTRANSFORM worldWand tmp/worldWand buttons 1
ADDCHILD worldWand world

# put an object under it
LOAD axis axis.osg
ADDCHILD axis worldWand

# this node reads the sceneWand matrix from shared memory when right button is pressed
# you'll get a frame of latency
#SHMMATRIXTRANSFORM sceneWand tmp/sceneWand buttons 4
#ADDCHILD sceneWand scene
# hopefully you'll only see one axis, as both of them are im the same place
#ADDCHILD axis sceneWand
