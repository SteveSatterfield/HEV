As the complexity of the hev-playAudioFiles increased, so did the complexity of the input. So the GUI was created to provide an easy and visual way for the user to track the current state of the program, from the many various settings to the set of loaded files. However, implementing a GUI may seem counter intuative as the goal is not to have a GUI pop up every time a simulation is run, but instead launch and funtion seamlessly. Just for this reason, the GUI provides the ability to save a configuration of settings out to a simple config file, which would then be loaded into the command line execution of the program.
