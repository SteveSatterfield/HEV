hev-unformSlider

.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBhev-uniformSlider node uniform [val min max]

.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBhev-uniformSlider\fR is a GUI which prints the SGE UNIFORM command 
to change the value of a shader scalar vairable.

.SH OPTIONS

.IP \fBval\fR 
specifies the initial value of the shader variable. If omitted, 0 is used.
.IP \fBmin\fR 
specifies the initial minimum for range of shader variable. If omitted, 0 is used.
.IP \fBmax\fR 
specifies the initial maximum for range of shader variable. If omitted, 1 is used.

.SH EXAMPLE
After a vizualization with point data is running and the fatpoint shader is 
applied,

  $hev-uniformSlider pts fatpointSize 0.1 0.0 0.2 | hev-sgeWriteFifo & 

will create a slider with a range 0.0 to 0.2 and a starting value of
0.1 that will change the fatpointSize variable for everything under
the node called pts. The output (SGE commands) from the roller are
piped to the SGE FIFO using the \fBhev\-sgeWriteFifo\fR command. 

Also see test.sh in $HEVROOT/savg/dgl/src/hev\-uniformSlider

.SH NOTE

The uniform variable must exist for the command to have any effect.

The output from hev\-uniformSlider MUST be piped to hev\-sgeWriteFifo. 
Otherwise the SGE commands are just printed to stdout.

.SH BUGS

No known bugs
