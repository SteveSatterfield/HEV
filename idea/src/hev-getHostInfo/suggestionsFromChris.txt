No, not a slow day by any means...

Thanks for the reference to your homedir.

In general, looks good.  Of course I have a few suggestions...mostly to reduce some clutter and extra work.


1.  Don't use ssh -q, which suppresses all error messages, but rather use ssh -o LogLevel=error to only silence the /etc/issue login banner.

2.  efficiency nitpicks, such as instead of this in nvCards function:

echo `hostname` ; if [ -d /proc/driver/nvidia ] ; then \
               cat /proc/driver/nvidia/gpus/*/information  |\
               grep Model | sed "s/Model://" ; else echo "                 Directory: /proc/driver/nvidia not found" ; fi

pertinent stuff could be (eliminate calls to hostname, grep and complexity)

echo $HOSTNAME; [ -d /proc/driver/nvidia ] && cat /proc/driver/nvidia/gpus/*/information | sed -n 's/Model://p' || echo -e "\tDirectory: /proc/driver/nvidia not found"

Note this will not work if the nvidia driver is not installed...perhaps this?  Seems simpler...

lspci | sed -n 's/.* VGA compatible controller: //p'
NVIDIA Corporation GT200GL [Quadro FX 5800] (rev a1)
NVIDIA Corporation GT200GL [Quadro FX 5800] (rev a1)
NVIDIA Corporation GT200GL [Quadro FX 5800] (rev a1)
NVIDIA Corporation GT200GL [Quadro FX 5800] (rev a1)

or just pick out just what's in the brackets for VGA can be done with a moderately challenging sed regular expression...I can walk you through it if interested/needed.

[schanzle@copious tmp]$ lspci | sed -n 's/.* VGA compatible controller: .*\[\([^]]*\).*/\1/p'
GeForce GT 430

# similar to above, added \t for indenting
[schanzle@tylium ~]$ lspci | sed -n 's/.* VGA compatible controller: .*\[\([^]]*\).*/\t\1/p'
    Quadro FX 5800
    Quadro FX 5800
    Quadro FX 5800
    Quadro FX 5800



In centOSversion,you have:
function centOSversion {
        ssh -q $host 'echo `hostname` `cat /etc/redhat-release  |\
        head -1`' |\
        awk '{printf "%-30s %s %s %s %s\n", $1,$2,$3,$4,$5}'
}

rather than "cat ... | head -1" why not just "head -1 ..." ?
And that long awk / printf -- why only the first 5 words?  Breaks on chinacat.
host=chinacat centOSversion
chinacat.cam.nist.gov          Fedora release 21 (Twenty

Could you live with the simplified version below?

function centOSversion {
         ssh $host 'printf %-30s $HOSTNAME; head -1 /etc/redhat-release';
}

[schanzle@copious ~]$ host=chinacat centOSversion
chinacat.cam.nist.gov         Fedora release 21 (Twenty One)
[schanzle@copious ~]$ host=copious centOSversion
copious.cam.nist.gov          CentOS Linux release 7.0.1406 (Core)
[schanzle@copious ~]$ host=vail centOSversion
vail.cam.nist.gov             CentOS release 6.6 (Final)


and finally, for the nvidia driver version, I've used this in my update scripts which prints just the numeric version.

f=/proc/driver/nvidia/version
[ -e $f ] && echo `sed -n '1s/.*Module  \([^ ]*\).*/\1/p' $f` || echo "(kernel module not loaded)"

It seems you cut off the year with your awk...need another %s and $16:

$ host=tylium nvDriver
tylium.cam.nist.gov            340.65            Dec 2 09:50:34 PST

[schanzle@copious ~]$ ssh tylium cat /proc/driver/nvidia/version
NVRM version: NVIDIA UNIX x86_64 Kernel Module  340.65  Tue Dec  2 09:50:34 PST 2014
