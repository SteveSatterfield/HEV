.SH NAME

fxcam - effects camera OSG pseudo-loader


.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBfxcam\fR is an OSG pseudo-loader for per-frame post processing
effects. As a pseudo-loader, it behaves as a file loader, but
interprets the file name as a command for the pseudo-loader rather
than as an actual file to load. The \fBfxcam\fR
pseudo-loader creates three nodes based on the filename given. If
asked to load \fIname\fR.fxcam, the pseudoloader will create the
following named nodes:

.IP "\fIname\fR"
The parent node. This is the node used to add or remove the fxcam
subtree from the OSG scene graph.

.IP "\fBpre_\fIname\fR"
Anything attached to this node is rendered into a pair of
color and depth textures. The rendered geometry will not be visible
unless textured onto visible geometry.

.IP "\fBpost_\fIname\fR"
Anything attached to this node is rendered normally and will be
visible in the final frame. However, geometry attached to
\fBpost_\fIname\fR can use the generated color and depth textures from
\fBpre_\fIname\fR to perform image post-processing effects. Shaders
can tell if they are attached to the \fBpost_\fIname\fR node by
checking if the shader uniform bool \fBfxcam\fR is true. The color
texture is a texture rectangle attached to texture unit 0, with the
shader name \fBfxcamColor\fR. The depth texture is also a texture
rectangle, attached to texture unit 1, with the shader name
\fBfxcamDepth\fR.

.SH "FILES"

For the common case when the \fBpre_\fIname\fR geometry should be
visible, but either the color or depth texture are needed, attach the
following file to the \fBpost_\fIname\fR node. This file is installed
in \fI$HEVROOT/idea/data\fR, which should be in the file search
path, allowing just the file name to be used when loading.

.IP "\fBfxCopyFrame.osg\fR"
Creates a screen-filling square and copies the generated color \fIand
depth\fR into it. Since both color and depth are copied, it appears as
if it were the full 3D geometry.

.SH "BUGS"

The generated textures are hard-coded at 2048x2048. For smaller screen
sizes, this is wasteful. For huge screen sizes, this may be too
small. Could code into the pseudo-loader file name.
