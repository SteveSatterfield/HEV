Volume rendering test. 

Should show bucky ball volume in yellows and reds embedded in a
polygonal airplane model. Requires write-permission to test directory.

To run:
  ./rundemo [volume|mixed] [point|linear|preint] [emit|lit|preint] <scale>
  First argument = demo type:
    "volume" shows volume alone
    "mixed" shows volume embedded with polygonal airplane model
  Second argument = integration type:
    "point" does point sampling along rays
    "linear" does linear interpolation between transfer colors
    "preint" uses preintegrated transfer function table
  Third argument = transfer function type
    "emit" uses a simple emission/absorption model (for "point" or "linear")
    "lit" uses a gradient-based lighting model (for "point" or "linear")
    "preint" uses a preintegrated transfer function table (for "preint")
  Final argument scales optical distance (20 works well for the example)

To do live updates of transfer function
  Edit transfer.dat
  ./texture [point|linear|preint] <scale>
  Arguments are integration type and scale as above

To view current transfer function (does not track live updates):
  osgviewer transferPlot.osg

Files:
  rundemo	= sample script to create and run volume renderer
    texture	= script to load volume data and transfer function
  volume.iris    = scene graph snippet to load volume only
    mixed.iris   = scene graph snippet to combine volume and geometry
  bucky.mha	= header describing volume data
    bucky.raw	= raw volume data (need both bucky files)
    tex3d.osg	= state file to load volume data
  transfer.dat  = user-editable transfer function
    preint.osg, transfer.osg = state files to load transfer lookup tables
    emit.dat, lit.dat = sample transfer functions, copy to transfer.dat
  transferPlot.osg = object to show transfer function on a checkered square

Generated files
  box.ive	= wireframe box to show volume size
  bucky.osg	= volume rendering object
  transfer.mhd  = processed transfer texture created from transfer.dat
