.SH NAME

hev-LUT2mhd


.SH SYNOPSIS

.B hev-LUT2mhd
.I [--scale volumeScale] < file.lut > file.mhd


.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBhev-LUT2mhd\fR creates a 1D transfer function texture from a 1D
lookup table. \fBfile.lut\fR is a 1D lookup table mapping values in
the volume to color and opacity, as generated by
\fBhev-createLUT\fR. \fBfile.mhd\fR is a 1D texture, where the value
of the texel at \fIu\fR indicates the color and opacity that would
result from passing a unit distance through a volume with that value.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 
.B --scale \fIvolumeScale\fR
Scales the optical distance. 
.IP
An alpha of 0.5 in the transfer function means that only half the
light will make it through a one unit long segment of volume. If the
volume is scaled so the segment is instead three units long, half the
light will make it through the first unit of volume, half of that
through the second unit, and half of \fIthat\fR through the third, for
a total of 0.5*0.5*0.5 = 0.125 of the light making it through the
whole volume. This effect may make the transfer function too opaque
(as in this example), or too transparent when reused on a volume of
different size. The \fIvolumeScale\fR factor will correct for
this. Values greater than one make the volume more opaque, while
values less than one make the volume more transparent. In the above
example, a \fIvolumeScale\fR factor of 1/3 will adjust the transfer
function so half the light makes it through three units of volume.
.IP
The same effect can be accomplished with the scale factor in
\fBhev-volume\fR. Using the \fBhev-preintegrate\fR scale factor bakes
the scale change into the texture, while using the \fBhev-volume\fR
scale factor allows interactive rescaling in a running
application. The two scale factors multiply. For extreme rescaling
factors, it may be necessary to split the total scale factor across
both to preserve precision.

.SH EXAMPLE

See \fB$HEVROOT/savg/dgl/src/hev-volume/voltest\fR for examples of use
of \fBhev-LUT2mhd\fR in rendering a volume. In addition,
\fBtransferPlot.osg\fR in this directory will show a representation of
the pre-integrated transfer function.
