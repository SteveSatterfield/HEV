.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBnetx-pagerank\fR prints each node in the graph and its pagerank (nodes in ascending order by pagerank). This function uses a software package called NetworkX that must be installed for the function to work.

\fBinputFile\fR is a file in edge-list format that contains only text. It does not have any header information. The nodes can have any name, as long as each node has a unique name (i.e. you can't have two nodes both named "sam" in the same graph). Optionally, after listing the two nodes, various other edge attributes can be assigned. In this function, the first attribute is assumed to be the weight of the edge. No other attribute is used in this function. Below are two example input files. The first has no attributes, the second has one, weight.
