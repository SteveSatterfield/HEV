Subject: Re: doc/idea/overview

This is an ugly hack that I knocked out as part of the student documentation
that Judy wanted me to write a year or two ago..

In that directory is the shell script "makeManPDFs.sh" which generate
them. Also notice there's an index.html. Try loading
file:///usr/local/HEV/doc/idea/overview/index.html

In the idea to-do file $HEVROOT/idea/src/README.thingsToDo I have the
comment:

   modify the idea gnumakefile.include so it creates PDF versions of each man
   page and builds a web page of all man pages. Modify the IDEA wiki to use
   these PDFs

"IDEA wiki" refers to the page
http://snippet.cam.nist.gov:8000/rave/wiki/IRIS_IDEA_MainDoc, which has a
pointer to the URL in the second paragraph, above.
