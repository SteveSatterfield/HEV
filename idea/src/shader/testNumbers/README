Test programs for shader printing
=================================

Running the tests
-----------------
    make
    irisfly something.iris

There are two samples. Both display a sphere, with one column of one
of the transformation matrices overlaid on top. The key iris commands
for printing numbers are the TXTR line, loading numbers.tif into an
otherwise unused texture unit (this example uses texture unit 3), the
UNIFORM line setting the 'numbers' variable to that texture unit
number, and a fragment shader that uses the number printing code from
numbers.glsl

screen.iris, screen.frag.i
--------------------------
Prints screen-aligned numbers centered on the object. These are always
facing the viewer and right side up, but do not scale with the object
size, so may fall off of the edge of the object

surface.iris, surface.frag.i
----------------------------
Prints numbers on the surface of the object, aligned with the surface
texture coordinates. If the object is rotated the wrong way, these may
not be visible, and from inside the object they'll look backwards, but
they always show the full number and look more like they are attached
to the object itself.
