be used to test a software program to show that it has some specified
set of behaviours.

Steve,

    Ultimately, I would like at least one test for the possible CAVE 
demo components.
I want to start off as simple as possible:

1. different set of white points in 3D that we look at from different 
directions with the timeline
file and grab an image at specific points.

2. different set of white lines in 3D (eg tetratehdra) that we look at 
from different directions with the timeline
file and grab an image at specific points.

4. different set of images in 3D  that we look at from different 
directions with the timeline
file and grab an image at specific points.

5. scenegraph where things can be turned off and on via the FIFO, that 
we look at from different directions with the timeline file and grab an 
image at specific points.

6. different shader objects  that can be turned off and on via the FIFO, 
that we look at from different directions with the timeline file and 
grab an image at specific points.

7. ... (pull up a specific frame in the VCR...

ideas to things to test?
