<H2>Quick Start</H2>
</a>
<p>
If you want to get started quickly with hev-lightEditor
without reading all of this documentation, try this:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Startup irisfly in desktop mode with some models that
you're familiar with.
You can even run one of the standard demos.
</li>
<li>
After irisfly has started up, run the following command:
<pre><code>
    hev-lightEditor > $IRIS_CONTROL_FIFO
</code></pre>
The light editor GUI should appear.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
The program can also be run in the immersive environment, 
but to do that requires a different startup procedure.
For more details about how to run hev-lightEditor, see
<a href="#usage">Running hev-lightEditor</a>.
</p>

<br><br>


<a name="overview"
<H2>Overview</H2>
</a>


<p>
hev-lighteditor works by sending IRIS control commands to modify the
scene graph.  
This provides interactive control for the following lighting tasks:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
	 creating light sources and placing them in the scene graph
</li>

<li>
	 specifying light source colors and intensity
</li>

<li>
	 specifying light source type (infinite, omni-directional, spot light)
</li>

<li>
	 specifying light source location, direction, etc.
</li>

<li>
	 specifying light source attenuations
</li>

<li>
	 reading and writing light source files
</li>
</ul>


<p>
In the future, hev-lightEditor will enable the user to interactively
control the characteristics of the light model.
</p>

<p>
Here's a typical way that hev-lightEditor could be used:
</p>

<pre><code>
    hev-lightEditor > $IRIS_CONTROL_FIFO
</code></pre>

<p>
The section <a href="#usage">Running hev-lightEditor</a> describes
how to invoke hev-lightEditor in more detail.
</p>






<p>
For more information about the meaning of the various lighting parameters
used by hev-lightEditor, you can look at:
</p>

<pre>
    OpenGL Programming Guide, Second Edition
    Mason Woo, Jackie Neider, and Tom Davis.
</pre>

<p>
Chapter 5 is all about lighting and material surface properties.
This chapter will make it clear that lighting, as such, is only
part of the story.  
The other side of the coin is the specification of surface material
properties.  These properties interact with the lighting environment
to determine how polygons and other entities are rendered.
hev-lightEditor does not deal with material properties.
</p>

<p>
hev-lightEditor is designed to be used either on the desktop
or in the immersive environment.  
In order to accomplish this, the design might not be ideal for
either environment.  
The program controls lighting by means of a GUI with standard
user interface widgets, 
so the controls of light location and direction are interactive
but they are indirect.  To move a light, you manipulate widgets that
specify the position of the light; as you work with those widgets,
the position of the light in the virtual scene is continuously updated.
</p>

<br>
<br>

<a name="interface">
<H2>Description of the Interface</H2>
</a>



<p>
The hev-lightEditor GUI is currently divided into four tabbed panels:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="#lightSourcesPanel">Light Sources</a></li>
	<li><a href="#lightModelPanel">Light Model</a></li>
	<li><a href="#globalPanel">Global Settings (unimplemented)</a></li>
	<li><a href="#filesPanel">Files</a></li>

</ul>

<strong>A Note on Numeric Fields in the GUI</strong>
<div style="margin-left: 60px; margin-right: 60px;">
<p>
hev-lightEditor uses many standard user interface widgets: drop down
menus, on/off buttons, radio buttons, sliders, and so on.
There is one type of widget that is slightly unusual; it is
a combination of a numeric text entry field and a slider.
All of the numeric fields that you see in this interface
are widgets of this type.  
</p>
<p>
You can click on any numeric field
and enter a value by typing it in, or you can click down on
the field and drag your pointer to the left and right.
As you drag your pointer
to the left or right, it acts like a slider, continuously
changing the value in the field.  When used with a 3-button
mouse, dragging with the left mouse button changes the
value with the smallest increment; the middle mouse button
changes the value with a larger increment and the right
mouse button changes it with a still larger increment.
</p>

<p>
In many cases, this type of numeric field is accompanied
by a slider or some other manipulator that has similar functionality.
We include these multiple methods (and multiple widgets) 
in order to provide alternatives to the user.  
One other substantial advantage of the
numeric text entry / slider combination widget
is that it conserves screen space, which is particularly
important when used in the immersive environment..  
</p>
</div>


<a name="lightSourcesPanel">
<H3>Light Sources Panel</H3>

<p>
At the top of the light sources panel, there are a few widgets that
apply to all types of light sources:
</p>

<p>
<img src="lseLSTop.png" alt="GUI: Top of Light Source Panel">
</p>

<p>
Here is a description of each widget:
</p>

<dl>
	<dt> Light ID - menu</dt>
		<dd>
		This allows the user to select one of the eight
		available light sources.  All other widgets on
		this panel will affect the light specified here.
		<br> <br>
		</dd>

	<dt> On / Off - button  </dt>
		<dd>
		Specifies whether the light is turned on or off.
		<br> <br>
		</dd>

	<dt> Node - menu </dt>
		<dd>
		This menu enables the user to place the light source
		under any of the standard scene graph nodes.
		Here is a diagram showing the hierarchy of these
		nodes:
		<p>
		<img src="diverseSceneGraph.png" alt="Standard scene graph nodes.">
		</p>
		A description of these nodes and their
		associated coordinate systems is beyond the scope 
		of this documentation.

		<br> <br>
	
		</dd>

	<dt> Edit mode:  Color | Position etc. </dt>
		<dd>
		This choice specifies whether the user wishes to 
		edit the the color parameters of the light source
		or the positional parameters.  The user can switch
		back and forth between the modes at any time.
		This selection determines the widgets that are
		presented in the lower panel of the GUI
		<br> <br>
		</dd>

</dl>

<H4> Edit Mode: Color </H4>

<p>
When you have selected the Color edit mode, 
hev-lightEditor displays a set of widgets that enable you to 
manipulate the color(s) of the light source:
</p>


<p>
<img src="lseColorGray.png" alt="GUI: Color Edit Mode">
</p>


<p>
The widgets:
</p>


<dl>
	<dt> Reset - button </dt>
		<dd>
		Resets the color parameters to default values.
		<br> <br>
		</dd>

	<dt> Link Ambient, Diffuse, and Specular Together - button</dt>
		<dd>
		Indicates whether you want to control all three
		light color types at the same time.
		When you change any one of the three, 
		the other two change in proportion.
		<br> <br>
		</dd>

	<dt> Edit R, G, and B Independently - button</dt>
		<dd>
		Specifies whether you want to edit just the intensity
		of a neutral colored light or whether you want to 
		change the red, green, and blue components separately.
		<br> <br>
		</dd>

	<dt> Ambient - button</dt>
		<dd>
		Indicates that you want to change the ambient color.
		<br> <br>
		</dd>

	<dt> Diffuse - button</dt>
		<dd>
		Indicates that you want to change the diffuse color.
		<br> <br>
		</dd>

	<dt> Specular - button</dt>
		<dd>
		Indicates that you want to change the specular color.
		<br> <br>
		</dd>

	<dt> Color Value - slider</dt>
		<dd>
		Allows interactive manipulation of the intensity of
		the color component in the range from 0 to 1.
		<br><br>
		</dd>

</dl>


<p>
When you have selected "Edit R, G, and B Independently", then the
interface is slightly reconfigured:
</p>

<p>
<img src="lseColorRGB.png" alt="GUI: Color Edit Mode">
</p>

<p>
In this case, you have sliders that let you
change the red, green, and blue components
of each color independenty.  Additionally, the wheel widget in 
the lower right corner becomes operational, 
which enables you to scale R, G, and B at the same time.
</p>

<br>


<H4> Edit Mode: Postion </H4>



<p>
When you have selected the Position edit mode, 
hev-lightEditor displays a set of widgets that enable you to 
manipulate the light's location, direction, and related settings.
The Light Type widget lets you specify what type of light
you want:
<dl>
	<dt>Infinite Light Source</dt>
	<dd>
		A light source that is infinitely far away; it has 
		a direction, but not a location.
		<br><br>
	</dd>


	<dt>Omni-Directional Light Source</dt>
	<dd>
		A light source that has a location in the scene,
		but shines in all directions.
		<br><br>
	</dd>

	<dt>Spot Light Source</dt>
	<dd>
		A light source that has a location in the scene,
		and shines in a particular direction with a specified
		cone of light.
		<br><br>
	</dd>

</dl>

</p>

<p>
Here's the interface for the <strong>infinite</strong> light source:
</p>

<p>
<img src="lsePosInf.png" alt="GUI: Position Edit Mode - Infinite Light">
</p>

<p>
The widgets:
</p>

<dl>
	<dt> Reset - button </dt>
	<dd>
		Resets the positional settings of the light source.
		<br><br>
	</dd>

	<dt> Direction Type - menu </dt>
	<dd>
		Indicates how you want to specify the light direction:
			<br><br>

		<dl>
		  <dt> Angles </dt>
		    <dd>
			Specify direction in the form of two angles.  
			These two angles can be thought of Heading and Pitch, 
			as Theta and Phi (spherical coordinates), 
			or as Latitude and Longitude.  
			These are expressed in degrees.
			<br><br>
		    </dd>

		  <dt> X Y Z </dt>
		    <dd>
			Specify direction in the form of  vector in 3 space.
			<br><br>
		    </dd>
		</dl>

	</dd>


	<dt> Direction - button </dt>
	<dd>
		When this button is pressed, an auxiliary window is displayed
		that enables the user to interactively manipulate the direction.
		The appearance of this auxiliary window depends on the 
		setting of the Direction Type menu:
		<br> <br>

		<dl>
		  <dt> Angles - auxiliary window:</dt>
		    <dd>
			<br>
			<img src="lseHPDir.png" alt="GUI: Specifying direction as two angles.">
			<br><br>
		    </dd>

		  <dt> X Y Z - auxiliary window:</dt>
		    <dd>
			<br>
			<img src="lseXYZDir.png" alt="GUI: Specifying direction as an XYZ vector.">
			<br><br>
		    </dd>
		</dl>


		<br><br>
	</dd>


</dl>




<p>
Here's the interface for the <strong>omni-directional</strong> light source:
</p>



<p>
<img src="lsePosOmni.png" alt="GUI: Position Edit Mode - Omni-Directional Light">
</p>

<p>
The widgets:
</p>

<dl>
	<dt> Reset - button </dt>
	<dd>
		Resets the positional settings of the light source.
		<br><br>
	</dd>


	<dt> Location - button </dt>
	<dd>
		When this button is pressed, an auxiliary window is displayed
		that enables the user to interactively manipulate the location
		of the light source in 3 space:
		<br> <br>
		<img src="lseLocation.png" alt="GUI: Specifying location in XYZ.">
		<br><br>
	</dd>

</dl>


<br> <br>

<p>
Here's the interface for the <strong>spot</strong> light source:
</p>

<p>
<img src="lsePosSpot.png" alt="GUI: Position Edit Mode - Spot Light">
</p>


<p>
The widgets:
</p>

<dl>
	<dt> Reset - button </dt>
	<dd>
		Resets the positional settings of the light source.
		<br><br>
	</dd>


	<dt> Location - button </dt>
	<dd>
		When this button is pressed, an auxiliary window is displayed
		that enables the user to interactively manipulate the location
		of the light source in 3 space.  This auxiliary window is
		identical to the location window used for the omni-directional
		light source.
		<br><br>
	</dd>

	<dt> Direction Type - menu </dt>
	<dd>
		This enables you to specify the spot light direction either
		as angles or as an XYZ vector.  This operates identically
		to the Direction Type menu of the infinite light source.
		<br><br>
	</dd>

	<dt> Direction - button </dt>
	<dd>
		When this button is pressed, an auxiliary window is displayed
		that enables the user to interactively manipulate the direction.
		These auxialiary windows are identical to those used for
		the infinite light source.
		<br><br>
	</dd>

	<dt> Spread Angle - slider </dt>
	<dd>
		The angle of the spread of the cone of light of the spot light.
		Beyond this angle the light has no effect.
		<br><br>
	</dd>

	<dt> Exponent - slider </dt>
	<dd>
		The exponent used to determine the distribution of light
		within the cone of the spot light. 
		When set to zero, the light is even across the entire
		spread of the light.  When it is greater than zero, the
		light is stronger at center line of the cone and diminishes
		as you move away from the center line.
		<br><br>
	</dd>

</dl>


<br> <br>

<p>
<strong>Attenuation</strong> of the omni-directional and spot light sources
 an be specified by the three widgets at the bottom of the panel:
</p>

<p>
<img src="lseAtten.png" alt="GUI: Attenuation settings.">
</p>


<p>
These three attenuations (constant, linear, and quadratic) are described
in detail in the OpenGL Programming Guide.
They determine how the brightness of omni-directional and
spot lights drop off as objects move away from the light sources.
</p>


<br><br>


<a name="lightModelPanel">
<H3>Light Model Panel</H3>
</a>


<p>
The Light Model panel enables the user to manipulate the 
characteristics of the global lighting model.  
The lighting model is described in detail in the OpenGL Programming Guide.
Here's the interface for the light model as it first appears:
</p>

<p>
<img src="lseLMGray.png" alt="GUI: Light Model - neutral color.">
</p>

<p>
The widgets:
</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Reset - button</dt>

<a name="usage">
<H2>Running hev-lightEditor</H2>
</a>

<p>
hev-lightEditor runs in concert with irisfly.
As the user manipulates the hev-lightEditor GUI, IRIS commands
are generated to reflect these interactions.  
These IRIS commands are written to standard output.  
In order to transmit these commands the output of hev-lightEditor
should be redirecty to $IRIS_CONTROL_FIFO.
</p>

<pre><code>
    hev-lightEditor > $IRIS_CONTROL_FIFO
</code></pre>

</p>
But it is important to note that irisfly must
already be running for this to work properly.  
So, typically, you will need to have started up irisfly
before issuing the command above.
</p>

<p>
It is also important to know that IRIS sends data back to hev-lightEditor
through a FIFO named /tmp/hev-lightEditor-fifo-<em>USER</em>, 
where USER is replaced by your user name.
This communication back from IRIS occurs during
initialization of hev-lightEditor; 
it is used to enable hev-lightEditor to control
lights that were created or loaded before it was started.  
</p>








<p>
If you want to run hev-lightEditor in stand-alone mode 
(without communicating with IRIS) 
you can do so by invoking it this way:

<pre><code>
    hev-lightEditor > /dev/null
</code></pre>

<p>
The program will operate normally, but it will take about six (6) seconds
to start up.  This delay occurs while the program is trying to establish
two-way communication with IRIS.  Eventually this attempt times out and
the program will function normally.
</p>

hev-lightEditor has the following <strong>command line arguments</strong>:

<dl>
	<dt>-e</dt>
	<dd>
	This argument causes the program to echo all 
	communications with IRIS to standard error.  
	It also sends a command to IRIS echo all received commands.
	This is intended as a debugging tool.
	<br><br>
	</dd>



	<dt>-h</dt>
	<dd>
	Causes the program to display a brief help message and exit.
	</dd>

<H2>Some Comments on Lighting and Material Specification</H2>
</a>

<p>
The effect of lighting on an object rendered by OpenGL and OSG is
determined by the interaction of light sources, the light model,  
and the material properties of the object.  
Both light sources and materials specify ambient, diffuse, and
specular rendering effects, and 
the light model specifies an ambient component.
This results in a myriad of approaches for achieving desired
lighting effects 
and I have often gotten confused by the many options.

</p>

<p>
I would like to suggest an approach to specifying materials and
lighting that might simplify the situation.  
This simplification means that some possible rendering effects
are not possible, but it provides an initial framework
for working with lights and materials.
You can always break out of this framework if you need different
types of effects.
</p>

<p>
The specific suggestions are based on the following general ideas:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
     Material colors (ambient, diffuse, and specular) should 
	generally be specified as bright colors.
</li>

<li>
     The balance of brightness of ambient, diffuse, and specular
        is achieved by modulating the corresponding components of
        the light sources and light model (not surface materials).
</li>

<li>
     All ambient lighting comes from the light model, none from
        the individual light sources.
</li>

</ul>


<p>
Here are some more specific suggestions on specifying materials and lights
that are based on these ideas:
</p>


<H4>Materials:</H4>

<ul>
	<li>
	Set the diffuse and ambient to the same colors.
	</li>

	<li>
	Set the specular color:
	   <ul>
		<li>
		(0,0,0) for no shiny highlights
		</li>
		<li>
		(1,1,1) for white highlights (this gives a sort of plastic appearance)
		</li>
		<li>
		same as diffuse - for highlights that correspond to the 
			base color of the object 
			(this tends to give a vaguely metallic appearance).
		</li>
	   </ul>
	</li>

	<li>
	If you use specular color, a shininess exponent of 25 is generally good.
	</li>
</ul>

<H4>Light Model:</H4>
<ul>
	<li>Setting the ambient to something like 
			(0.1, 0.1, 0.1) or (0.2, 0.2, 0.2) 
			is generally reasonable.

	<li>Setting the ambient lighting to (0,0,0) can give 
			a more dramatic lighting effect, 
			particularly when there are only one or 
			two lights in the scene.
</ul>

<H4>Light Sources:</H4>

<ul>
	<li>You generally want neutral color lights; 
			let the objects specify their own colors with 
			their material properties.
	</li>

	<li>Set ambient color to 0; let the light model handle ambient light.
	</li>

	<li>
	Set diffuse and specular lighting to similar values 
			with diffuse >= specular
	</li>

	<li>Sum of all components of a single light should be <= 1
	</li>

	<li>Sum of all components of a single light should be 
			reduced as you introduce more lights into 
			the scene.  
			(This is particularly true when using 
			infinite and omni-directional lights.)
	</li>

</ul>


<p>
As you specify material and light properties and add multiple
lights to a scene, 
it is important to understand a major difference between lighting
in the real world and lighting in the virtual world.  
In the real world, as you add more lights to a scene,
objects will get brighter and brighter.
This is also true in the virtual world, but only up to a point.
In the virtual world, we can think of colors as being 
represented as RGB components each of which ranges from 0 to 1.
When you add another light to the virtual scene, the RGB components
will get higher, but they can't go above 1.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, one of the red, green, or blue components might
saturate to 1.0 before the others.  So the others can still
increase while the other is pegged at 1.0.  This can result in 
color shifts when adding lighting.  And when the color of an
object (or a portion of an object) reaches the maximum of full
white (1,1,1) then you lose the continuous light source shading
that is critical for revealing the shape of the surface.
So if you see objects getting washed out, or see color shifts
when you add more lights, you should think about reducing the
intensities of some or all of your light sources.
