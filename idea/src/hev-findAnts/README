hev-findAnts has a couple of new options and they required
restructuring the scripts.

The -u option searches in the user's evnironment, with any
environment variables the user has changed. For example, if
the user changes the PATH variable to search first in his
directory, hev-findAnts may find commands or documentation
in the user's directory that are not part of the current
release. This option is check before any other option, to
make sure it is running in the correct environment.

To implement -u, I moved all of the other functionality of
hev-findAnts to a helper called _hev-findAnts. The new
hev-findAnts first checks for the -u option. If it is not
found, it will run in a "clean" environment. I do this 
using the exec -c command to run bash --norc --noprofile.
Before bash is executed, I use the env command to pass on
some specifiy environments to the new process. Then bash
runs the helper, _hev-findAnts, passing through any commnd 
line options for the helper to digest.

The -c option requires a numeric argument. This will cause
the output to be displayed in the specified number of 
columns.

I've also written some new commands, hev-checkAnts and
hev-testAnts.

hev-checkAnts starts with a log file that is known to be
correct. the log contains a single column list of all commands,
with full paths and group headings removed.

Next, the command generates a new log file that SHOULD be 
identical to the refernce and compares them. Any difference 
found are reported, output to sdterr. If the differences
are ok, i.e. offical changes since the last time it was 
checked, the user will have the option of replacing the 
old log with the new. If not, both logs are retained and
the user will have to resolve the differences. Otherwise, 
since they are identical, there is nothing to be done.

I made another helper that hev-checkAnts uses called 
hev-listAnts. It runs hev-findAnts in a single column,
removes group headers and blank lines, strips off the 
man page flag and prepends command name with the path. 
I decided that this particular output format is specific
to hev-checkAnts so hev-listAnts is not useful to the
general public.

hev-testAnts simply runs hev-findAnts with each option and
outputs the results to stdout. The user must observe this
output and determine if it is correct. This ensures that
every control branch of the script is run, in case there
is a but in a lesser used option.
