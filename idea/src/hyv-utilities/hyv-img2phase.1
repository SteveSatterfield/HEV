.SH NAME
hyv-img2phase
- convert *.img files to *.phase files

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "hyv-img2phase"
[--parallel n] [--ext string] phaseNumber exprString  dataDir | imgFile

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I
hyv-img2phase
will convert all
.B *.img
files to
.B *.phase.
A required expression string specifies how to convert the multiple columns on
the
.B img
file into a single column
.B phase
file.

Each output
.B phase
file is a single column of numbers.
The command is invoked multiple times to generate multiple phases.



.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB--parallel n\fR"
specifies how many concurrent processes to be used convert
in parallel. On a 2 CPU machine, n of 2 is a good number.

.IP "\fB--ext string\fR"
is an optional parameter that changes the .extension
portion of the generated file names. When not specified,
files are named as \fI.phase\fR.




.IP "\fBphaseNumber\fR"
is an integer used to identify the phase being created.

.IP "\fBexprString\fR"
is an expression specifying which column is selected or how multiple columns
are combined.

The expression follows perl syntax for arrays where the first element of the
array is refers to column 1.  Thus column 2 is $c[2], etc.

To extract column 3 from the
.B img
file into a
.B phase
file the parameter would be '$c[3]'.

Columns can be combined, for example: '$c[2]+$c[4]' Other typical operations
can be performed, for example '($c[1]+2*$c[3])/2'

The expression must result in a single value.

If the expression is invalid, the output file will have a value of 0.
Perhaps this should be an error. However, there is a special case
of computing pH were data of 0 means pH undefined, so we'll
output a pH of 0 to indicate undefined


.IP "\fBdataDir\fR"
is an existing directory containing the 
.B img
file.
The resulting
.B phase
files are written to
.B dataDir
with names in the form of 
.B *_{P}.phase
where
.B {P}
is the specified
.B phaseNumber.

.IP "\fBimgFile\fR"
if an
.B img
file is specified rather than a directory name,
then the single specified
.B img
file is converted to a
.B phase
file in the current directory.



.SH EXAMPLE

.PP
Run with 2 parallel processes creating phase 3 by adding columns 4 and 5.

.IP
hyv-img2phase --parallel 2  3 '$c[4]+$c[5]' C3Ssmall
