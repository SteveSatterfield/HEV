Data Flow (top to bottom) description of commands for HydratiCA Visualization

 This document is a snapshot of work in progress. This description is not
 complete and is subject to change as the software develops.

Arbitary Directory   *.img
                     contains the img file produced by hyratiCA runs
                     multicolumn data

      |
      |    hyv-selection      selection tool to pick a subset cp or symlinks
      |
      V

IMG                *.img
                   Subset of img files of interest to work with
      		   This is a subdirectory of the current directory
		      as are the following direcories
      		   multi-column data
      |      
      |
      |    hyv-img2phase   pick column/combine columns to 1
      |                    execute multiple time for multiple phases
      |
      V

Phase              *_{P}.phase       desired phases
                   P is the phase number
   |   |
   |   |
   |   |    hyv-phase2vtk  convert to vtk format
   |   |
   |   V
   |
   |        hyv-phase2iso  compute an iso value for each phase file
   |                       necessary to compute the isosurface
   V

VTK	           *_{P}.vtk        VTK represetation of phase
      |
   |  |
   |  |      hyv-vtk2ivu    run the isosurface command
   |  |
   |  |
      V
 ISO               *_{P}.iso

   |  |
   |  |
   |  |
   V  V

IVU                *_{P}.ivu        isosurface in ivu format

      |
      |
      |     hyv-ivu2ive         optimize and conver to ive
      |
      V

IVE                *_{P}.ive        isosurfaces in ive format




All commands have a "-parallel N" option (modeled after hev-osgOptimize)
Perhaps the basic structure can be

	cmd -parallel N {other specific options} inDir outDir

so that everything moves from directory to directory.
Do I assume the target is empty? 
Or I could require that it not exist and create it.

Or should I force everything to be in a single directory.
