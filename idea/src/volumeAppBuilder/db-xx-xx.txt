Subject: [HPCVG] Volume rendering update

I've just updated the volume renderer and hev-preintegrate and 
hev-LUT2mhd utilities to allow transfer functions with colors bigger 
than 1. By setting opacities less than 1 (even .9), but some transfer 
values bigger than 1 (2-10ish is probably good) for important stuff to 
see in the volume, that important stuff will show through the 
intervening darker volume. It won't punch through anything that's 
completely opaque, so an opacity of 1 still stops everything behind it.

Three examples attached to the brightest we used to be able to make a 
part of the volume, and the kinds of effects you can now get by raising 
the brightness above 1.

This update includes some changes in the way transfer functions work in 
the guts of the volume renderer. If you happen to have a custom transfer 
function (and I think the ones I did for the fire are the only one we 
have so far), you'll need to update the function signature and call 
voldata from inside the transfer function. Anyone playing with fire 
should use the updated apps/fire/volfire script to get the updated 
custom fire transfer functions. This only matters when you generate the 
application. After that, the shaders are embedded in the osg files, so 
unaffected by my changes.
