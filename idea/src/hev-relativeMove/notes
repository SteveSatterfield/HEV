0) put objects under world node

     - scene -> 
         matrix node ->
	     objects

   start up hev-relativeMove process- input is wand and left button. changes
   when wand moves & button is pressed

   start up sceneToWorld process- input is output of hev-relativeMove
   process. changes when wand moves & button is pressed or when you navigate

   start up worldToScene processes- input is output of sceneToWorld process,
   but why is output different

1) button pressed

   - matrix node is set to to have the objects's world position changed to scene coords

   - set delta to zero

   - delta changes to the wand are applied to the clipping planes by
     changing the matrix node. relative move active

     - need to keep initial positoin and delta and multiply the two to set
       matrix node

     - can hev-relativeMove do this now?

2) button released

   - position of objects in world coords are put into matrix node and objects moved
     under the world node. relative move inactive

   - user navigates around a bit so the objects move with navigation

     - world -> 
           matrix node -> 
	     plane objects

3) button pressed, go back to 1)


relative mode needs:

 - shm to read to turn on/off: button press & button release

 - name of matrix node node to go above objects

 - what if instead of scene & world you specify two nodes, but one can not have
   nav as a parent (default is scene), and one must have world as a parent
   (default is world)

 - can you invoke a new hev-relativeMove every button press to reset
   initCoord to the scene coord of the navigated clipping plane?

current hev-relativeMove:

 - inShm: name of shared memory for input. default is wandMatrix

 - inXXXButtonShm: name of button state shared memory. default is either
   idea/button/left or idea/button/right

 - initCoord: initial output transformation. default is identity

 - boxConstrain: constrain output translation to the box dimensions if given

 - outShm: name of shared memory for output, in same coord system as inShm.

 - selectorShm: name of selector to activate/deactivate hev-relativeMove

mods?

 - can you give it the name of a fifo to read commands? Such as:
   RESET [ X Y Z [ H P R [ Xs Ys Zs ] ] ]
