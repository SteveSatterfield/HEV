Decided to include hev-which in the HEV tree and install as normal.
However, the script hev-which and man page hev-which.1 should be given
to Chris when updated so he can install as a normal Linux rpm and will
be available when no HEV environment has been set.



March 3, 2012 - steve

hev-which is not installed in the HEV tree.

Rather, hev-which and hev-which.1 are installed in /usr/local/bin and
/usr/share/man/man1 by Chris via rpm.

Created rpm package hev-which from mcsd-testing repo and installed on
vail for your testing pleasure.  I can promote to repo 'mcsd' (proper)
and install on all savg systems as you like.  Please review the files,
packaging details, check man page, etc.  FYI, rpm spec is
~schanzle/tmp/specs/hev-which.spec passed rpmlint tests (great since
it told me the files from your email were DOS-formatted EOL's).
