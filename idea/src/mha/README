OpenSceneGraph loaders for a subset of the ITK MHA/MHD meta image
format.

Each file consists of a human-readable (ascii text) file, which refers
to a packed binary data source, either in a separate file or embedded
in the header file. Header elements appear one per line, in any
order. Each line lists tag=value. White space and unknown header keys
are ignored.

Supports 1D, 2D and 3D textures, with 1-4 values per texel. Values can
by usnigned byte, unsigned short or float. 

Supported tags:
   NDims = <1-3>
      Indicates 1D, 2D or 3D texture

   DimSize = <int> [<int> [<int>]]
      Size of each texture dimension in x y z order

   ElementNumberOfChannels = <1-4>
      Number of channels in each texel. In OpenGL terms, 1 is an
      luminance texture, 2 is luminance/alpha, 3 is rgb, 4 is rgba

   HeaderSize = <int>
      Number of header bytes at the beginning of the data file
      -1 = compute size and start that far from the end of the
      file. -1 is particularly useful for reading files in other
      simple brick-of-bytes formats, since you can create an mha file
      describing the contents, then skip the native header. Using this
      approach, it is possible to use this loader for ppm or pfm files.

   BinaryDataByteOrderMSB = (true|false)
   ElementByteOrderMSB = (true|false)
      Either of these indicate the endianness of the data. Intel
      processor native byte order is little endian (or 'false')

   ElementType = MET_(UCHAR|USHORT|FLOAT)
      Type of data elements, both in the file, and as stored on the GPU

   ElementDataFile = (<file>|LOCAL)
      LOCAL starts on the *next* line of the file, and must be the
      last header line to appear. Other files are relative to the
      directory containing the mha file
    

Source files:
  osgdb_mha.cpp		MHA and MHD file loader

Support files for testing:
  test2D      script to test 2D file loading
  test3D      script to test 3D file loading
  testdata    directory containing some sample files
    testpgm.mha, test.pgm	   
  beach_probe.pfm	binary image from Paul Debevec's high dynamic
			range light probe collection

  test.pfma		2x2 test PFMA image (hand-written)
  test.pfm		2x2 test PFM image
			(gen. with hev-pfmaToPfm < test.pfma > test.pfm)
  testPmmGen.pl		perl script used to generate binary test.pmm
  test.pmm		128x128 test 4-channel PMM
			(generated with testPmmGen.pl)

Tests: 

  test2D creates a 2D mha file for the data, and an osg file to load
  it, and views it with 'osgviewer <test>.osg'. You should see a
  square in the middle of the screen textured with a test
  image. Points on the test image with values greater than 1.0 will
  cycle between being clamped to 1.0 (full intensity for that color
  channel), and red.

  test3D creates a 3D mha file for the data, and an osg file to load
  it. You should see a square in the middle of the screen, cycling
  back and forth between slices of the 3D texture.
