  I found the following notes in an old email. Maybe something to look at:

  Look at ivstick.

        length function not used
        why have line count
        is multiple separators needed. Isn't this a peformer hold over

  Fixed ivtexture to use a single polygon. It now works with current HEV (DGL,
  OSG based)

  ./test_ivstick is test current test and development area 

  ivtexture is just a very basic quick implementation. There are lots of other
  paratmers and commands that should be looked at. For example, what about
  texturing onto geometry other than a single polygon.

  There is now an ivlightmodel command. 

  The .ivu extension resolves issues with coordinate system and ivpffix is
  not so much needed

  The commands ivdirectionalight, ivpointlight, ivspotlight when used
  cause the .iv loader to segfault. I seem to remember this is an issue
  that needs some looking into. I believe I tried once and gave up.

  Fix ivtexture to work in Dgl (OSG) by changing it to use a single polygon
  rather around a cube. See: ~steve/ivFifles/ivtextureBug or ./ivtextureBug

  The current ivtexture is really just a quick hack.
  There are a number of commands related to texture. I relly need to look
  at a series of iv texture commands to properly inplement texture.

ivutilities: Look at enhancement to ivtext to allow extruded text. Need to
add "parts ALL" after the string.
Fix ivtexture to work in Dgl (OSG) by changing it to use a single polygon
rather around a cube. See: ~steve/ivFifles/ivtextureBug
Add a "ivlightmodel" command.
Rename ivpfivfix to something, perhaps ivivu or ivufix.
Add an ivutext command to do the text with up appropriate for OSG.
