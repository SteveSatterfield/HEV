Here are the changes that I've made over the last few days:

  savg-cone - added new way to calculate normals (see "revisedNormals" option)
  savg-reverse - added -noFlip option 
  savg-sphere - fixed problem with very large number of polygons
  savg-prism - added normals
  savg-tetra - added normals and added -unit option
  savg-octa - added normals and added -unit option
  savg-wireframe - fixed problem with polygons with line color on "polygon" line

  savg-reverse-normals - new program
  savg-add-normals - new program

  Some cleanup of man pages

  Removed some old source code that is no longer used.

  Didn't remove some other source that isn't being used, but I'm not
  clear that it won't be useful in the future.

  There are still some problems with some man pages...

JGH
