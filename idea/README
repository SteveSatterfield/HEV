IDEA Directories
----------------

In this directory, $HEVROOT/idea, all "source" files should be placed  
in the src subdirectory. All of the other subdirectories are for the
installed files that are accessed at run time. 

These runtime directories are currently:

    bin/
    data/
    doc/
    etc/
    examples/
    include/
    lib/
    main/
    shader/

But other runtime subdirectories could be added.  Again, the only 
subdirectory that is NOT a runtime directory is src.

When IDEA is rebuilt, all files that are in the runtime directories are 
deleted. Any files that should go into the runtime directories must by 
placed there by one of the GNUmakefiles under the src directory.
Specifically, "make install" should move required files into the runtime
directories.
